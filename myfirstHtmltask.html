 <h2 style="color: rgb(12, 129, 224);">hello there.....welcome to my world.</h2>
 <p class="note">I was born in kaduna in 14th january, 1995.But hail from uhualor village in ihembosi anambra state with my parents both from ihembosi town Anambra state.i spent most of my years in the northern part of the country where my parents lived,Before i went down to the easthern part to higher institution to gain a Bachelor of science degree in Biochemistry at Anambra state universty,Uli. </p>
 <p>In 2018,after graduation i went for my service where i ventured into several business ventures which kick started my love for entreprenuership and total need to be independent. </p>
 
 <p class="myclass">Fortunately for me my brother who is a computer science student was a python programmer,hence i was a little used to seeing him code, so i started getting fascinated with the assumed 'magic' a single code can perform.he was a backend programmer which was a limitation but he encouraged me to go for the language best suitable to me, which was frontend programming,i was able to gather some books and materials to help me start my journey into programming,then started home learning.</p>
 <p>Coincidentally,i came across HerTechTrailacademy cohort2 then is applied and here i AM!! </P>
